**Project: Cancer and Deaths Data Analysis with Power BI**  
This repository contains code and resources for creating interactive Power BI dashboards to analyze cancer and deaths data from 1990 to 2019 (globally).  

**Data Source:**  
The data set is from Kaggle: Cancer and Deaths Dataset (1990-2019) Globally: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/belayethossainds/cancer-and-deaths-dataset-19902019-globally  

**Analysis Overview:**  
**This project analyzes four files from the dataset:**  
cancer-death-rates-by-age  
number-of-people-with-cancer-by-age  
share-of-population-with-cancer-by-age  
cancer-deaths-rate-and-age-standardized-rate-index  

**Power BI Dashboards:  
Five interactive dashboards are created using Power BI, providing insights into various aspects of the data:**  

**Dashboard 1: Global Deaths by Year**  
Filter by year using a slicer.  
Stacked column chart shows the sum of deaths by year.  
Cards display the total and average deaths across all ages.  
Q&A card allows users to ask questions about the data.  
Map displays the number of deaths per country, with data filtering by selected country.  

**Dashboard 2: Deaths by Age Group**  
Line chart shows the sum of deaths by age group.  
Four additional charts focus on specific age ranges: 5-14, 15-49, 50-69, and 70+.  

**Dashboard 3: People Affected with Cancer by Year and Age**  
Analyzes yearly data on individuals affected by cancer across different age groups.  
Five stacked column charts represent age groups: under 5, 5-14, 15-49, 50-69, and 70+.  

**Dashboard 4: Cancer Cases Comparison**  
Area chart compares the number of people affected with cancer under 5 and above 70.  

**Dashboard 5: Multi-Year Cancer Analysis by Age **  
Explores trends through six stacked area charts, each focusing on a specific age group.  

**Further Exploration:**  
The provided code and data offer a starting point for further exploration and analysis of the cancer and deaths dataset using Power BI.
