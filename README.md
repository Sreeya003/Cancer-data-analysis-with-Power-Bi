5 Interactive Dashboards using Power Bi have been created.
Dashboard 1 contains:
Slicer is inserted where the values of year are given which can be used as a filter to know which year data is required.
A stacked column chart was made which compares the sum of deaths yearwise.
2 Cards have been made for calculation of both sum and average deaths of all age people.
A Q&A card is created to answer different question regarding the data.
A number of death in each country is indicated by using a map. By clicking on the country the values in the graph and cards will be changed country-wise.
